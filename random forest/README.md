Random Forest

In this folder, I am using random forest method. 
'First task' and 'Second task' are examples of using random forest method to make class predictions. The difference between the two files is that the dataset used in 'First task' has linear association, while the dataset used in 'Second task' has epistatic interaction.

'Parameter sweeping' talked about several important parameters in random forest classifier. 

'Filter-based feature selection' showed the result of three commonly filter-based feature selection methods on both datasets.

'Imputation 1' and 'Imputation 2' introduced several ways to deal with missing data and showed the performance of those methods.
